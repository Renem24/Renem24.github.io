## What is 'CBIR'?

finding the **similar images** from a large database for **query image**

---
## Evolution of 'CBIR'
### 1. Hand-Crafted Descriptor Based Image Retrieval

가장 초기에 등장한 CBIR method

**visual content**(**color**, **texture**, **shape**, **gradient**, etc.)에 기반한 retrieval

image의 **feature descriptor representation**에 크게 의존

**Feature descriptor representation**:
- **discriminating ability**, **robustness**, **low dimensionality** 필요
- **hand-designed** 또는 **hand engineered feature description**으로도 불림 

#### Cons.
- 정확한 비교에 사용하기는 어려움
	ex. recognition

### 2. Distance Metric Learning Based Image Retrieval

Machine Learning의 발전과 함께 등장한 CBIR method

image들간의 similarity를 계산하는 distance function을 학습하는 방식  

feature space에서 비슷한 image들은 가깝게, 비슷하지 않은 image들은 멀게 배치하는 것이 목적

일반적으로 [[#1. Hand-Crafted Descriptor Based Image Retrieval]]보다 높은 성능을 보임

#### Cons.
- 대다수의 방법들은 linear distance function을 사용하고 있음
	-> non-linear data에 대한 retrieval은 어려움

### 3. [[Deep Learning Based Image Retrieval]]

deep learning model을 사용해서 feature를 extract하는 방식

**Deep Learning Models**:
- [[CNN(Convolutional Neural Networks)]]
- [[Transformer]]
