> The blooming proliferation of aeronautics and astronautics platforms, alongside the ever-increasing remote sensing imaging sensors, has resulted in the formation of rapidly-growing earth observation data characterized by large volume, variety, velocity, veracity, and value. This shift has ushered us into an era of big earth data, also referred to as remote sensing (RS) big data. While RS big data presents significant opportunities for various applications such as disaster rescue and global security, it simultaneously introduces considerable processing challenges. Among the critical tasks in RS big data mining is image retrieval, which has garnered ongoing research interest over the past several decades. This paper systematically reviews emerging achievements in image retrieval from RS big data and discusses applications such as fusion-oriented RS image processing, geo-localization, and disaster rescue. To facilitate quantitative evaluation of RS image retrieval techniques, it provides a list of publicly available datasets and evaluation metrics while briefly summarizing mainstream methods on two representative benchmarks. The paper highlights promising research directions in RS big data mining, drawing on the latest advances in computer vision, machine learning, and knowledge engineering. This survey aims to equip industry engineers with skills to enhance RS image retrieval systems and inspire academic researchers with innovative work ideas.
